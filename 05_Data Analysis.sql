## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Categorizing Users by Activity Level
**Classifications:**
- **Sedentary Active:** `< 5000` steps
- **Lightly Active:** `5000 - 7499` steps
- **Fairly Active:** `7500 - 9999` steps
- **Very Active:** `>= 10000` steps

### üìù Method 1: Using CROSS JOIN
```
WITH average_steps_table AS (
    SELECT Id, ROUND(AVG(TotalSteps), 2) AS average_steps
    FROM `spheric-engine-432411-p0.case_study_2.daily_activity_cleaned`

    GROUP BY Id
)
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM average_steps_table), 2) AS sedentary_active_percentage FROM average_steps_table WHERE average_steps < 5000

  SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM average_steps_table), 2) AS very_active_percentage FROM average_steps_table WHERE average_steps >= 10000
) very_active_users;
```

### üìù Method 2: Using CASE Statement
```
WITH average_steps_table AS (
    SELECT Id, ROUND(AVG(TotalSteps), 2) AS average_steps
    FROM `spheric-engine-432411-p0.case_study_2.daily_activity_cleaned`

SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN average_steps < 5000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS sedentary_active_percentage,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN average_steps BETWEEN 5000 AND 7499 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS lightly_active_percentage,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN average_steps BETWEEN 7500 AND 9999 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS fairly_active_percentage,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN average_steps >= 10000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS very_active_percentage

‚úÖ **Lightly Active Users:** 20.0%  
‚úÖ **Fairly Active Users:** 22.86%  
‚úÖ **Very Active Users:** 20.0%
