Data is considered long format. 

**2.4 Data Integrity And Credibility**

The dataset's integrity and credibility were assessed using the ROCCC framework:

- Relevant: The dataset is a great fit for our analysis goals, as it offers valuable insights into user activity and behavior.
- Original: Since the data was gathered directly from users via a survey, it counts as primary data.
- Comprehensive: While the dataset provides useful information, it’s limited to just 35 users and only covers a two-month period. Additionally, it doesn’t include any geographical details, which could have added more depth.
- Current: Unfortunately, the dataset is a bit outdated and doesn’t capture recent trends or shifts in user behavior.
- Credible: On the plus side, the dataset comes from Kaggle, a well-known and reliable platform for sharing data, which adds to its credibility.


**3. Data Exploring, Combining and Preparing**

**3.1 Tools**
- Data cleaning and processing: Bigquery and PostgreSQL.
- Data visualization: PowerBI and Tableau

**3.2 Data Combining**

During the data consolidation phase, I combined the two months' worth of data into unified tables to streamline the analysis process. Specifically, I merged the data from daily_activity_1 (covering the period from March 12, 2016, to April 11, 2016) and daily_activity_2 (covering April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016) into a single table named daily_activity. I also combined the data from minute_sleep_1_v1 and minute_sleep_2_v1 into a new table called minute_sleep. However, due to some formatting inconsistencies in the date columns, I first had to upload both tables to Google Sheets, fix the formatting issues, and then download them again before merging. Finally, I unified the records from hourly_steps_1 and hourly_steps_2 into a single table named hourly_steps. This allowed me to analyze all step activity data from the two-month period in one place.

**3.4 Data Exploring**

In the data exploration phase, I performed various checks to assess the quality and consistency of the data across the tables daily_activity, minute_sleep, and hourly_steps.

*a. Exploring the Daily Activity Table:*

I examined the daily_activity table for potential null values across columns, data consistency, and duplicates. The results showed no null values, duplicate records, or data inconsistencies.

I ensured that the ActivityDate values were within the specified date range and found no inconsistencies or values outside the expected range.

I reviewed key activity-related columns like TotalSteps, Calories, and various distance measures to confirm they had no null or negative values and no inconsistencies in data formatting.

*b. Exploring the Minute Sleep Table:*

I explored the minute_sleep table for data format inconsistencies, particularly checking the date field for correct timestamp formatting. I found that the year 2016 was incorrectly represented as "0016" in some entries, which was flagged for correction.

*c. Reviewing the Hourly Steps Table:*

Similar checks were performed on the hourly_steps table, including a review of the ActivityHour field, where the year "2016" had been incorrectly imported as "0016." This was noted for correction.

**3.5 Data Preparing**

In the data preparation phase, several tasks were performed to clean and organize the data. First, a new table was created (daily_activity_cleaned) by removing 17 Invalid records were removed where users were sedentary but still recorded movement. Then, user activity data was categorized into four groups based on average steps: sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active users, and separate tables were created for each group. In addition, date format inconsistencies in the minute_sleep and hourly_steps tables were corrected. Finally, the average minutes of sleep per weekday were calculated and displayed for each user.

**4. Data Analysis**

*4.1 Users count*

35 users were identified.

*4.2 Average daily steps and calories*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a376b4a-ddea-465e-b97a-796149e892d4)

The visualization includes two bar charts. The first chart, titled "Average Daily Steps," reveals that the average step count per day ranges from 6,200 to 7,600 steps across the week. This is below the widely recommended target of 10,000 steps per day, a benchmark often associated with health benefits like improved fitness and reduced risk of chronic diseases.  As noted by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm), walking 10,000 steps daily is a well-established goal for maintaining an active lifestyle.

The second chart, "Average Daily Calories," shows that the average calories burned each day fall between 2,100 and 2,400. This aligns with general caloric guidelines for adults. According to the [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.fda.gov/media/112972/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com), adult women typically need between 1,600 and 2,400 calories per day, while adult men require 2,000 to 3,000 calories daily, depending on factors like age, sex, and activity level. These findings suggest that while step counts may fall short of the ideal target, calorie expenditure remains within a healthy range for most adults.

*4.3 Type of users based on activity level*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df55bef6-5f85-456f-956a-a7f1c8254e1e)


This chart breaks down users into four activity-level categories: **Fairly Active**, **Very Active**, **Lightly Active**, and **Sedentary Active**. The data reveals that the largest group is **Sedentary Active users**, making up 28.57% of the total. Following closely, **Fairly Active users** represent 25.71%. Meanwhile, both **Very Active** and **Lightly Active users** are tied at 22.86% each. This distribution highlights that a significant portion of users fall into the less active categories, with nearly a third being sedentary and only about a quarter being fairly or very active. The categories in the chart correspond to [commonly used classifications for physical activity levels](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3169444/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) which are:

- **Sedentary**: Less than 5,000 steps per day.
- **Lightly active**: Between 5,000 and 7,499 steps per day.
- **Fairly active**: Between 7,500 and 9,999 steps per day.
- **Very active**: More than 10,000 steps per day.

*4.4 Average steps per hour*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a750848b-aaa6-4c2a-9f3c-cdc65e88bee4)

This chart displays the average number of steps users take over a 24-hour period. The x-axis represents the hours of the day (from 1 to 24), while the y-axis shows the average step count. The data reveals clear patterns in user activity, with noticeable spikes in movement during the morning and evening hours—times when people are typically most active. Conversely, step counts dip significantly during late-night and early-morning hours, reflecting lower activity levels. This visualization effectively pinpoints when users are at their most and least active throughout the day.

*4.5 Steps, minutes sleep and caloris*

Daily Steps vs Minutes Sleep

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/912dc09d-4490-467c-827e-a6568f65c838)

The chart reveals no significant correlation between the two variables—**Daily Steps** and **Minutes Sleep**—indicating that increased walking doesn’t necessarily result in more or less sleep. 

**Key observations:**  
- Most data points cluster within the range of **3,000 to 12,000 steps** and **5 to 10 hours of sleep**.  
- The trend line is nearly flat, showing that step count has little to no effect on sleep duration.  
- At higher step counts (above 20,000 steps), sleep duration becomes more varied, but no consistent pattern emerges.  

In short, the data suggests that daily step count doesn’t have a strong influence on how long people sleep.

Daily Steps vs Calories

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d945eab3-df3a-4593-86ef-7e732a6a3d4e)

Daily Steps vs. Daily Calories

The chart reveals a positive correlation, where more steps generally lead to higher calorie expenditure.

Key observations:
- The biggest jump in calories burned happens when users take between 5,000 and 15,000 steps.
- Once step counts go beyond 15,000, the rate of calorie burning starts to slow down, showing diminishing returns.
- The data indicates that moderate activity levels (within the 5K–15K step range) are the most effective for boosting calorie expenditure.

In other words, while increasing steps up to 15,000 significantly boosts calorie burn, pushing beyond that point yields smaller gains, making moderate activity the sweet spot for efficiency.

*4.6 Smart device usage patterns* 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55060db-ecf5-4843-8249-717605541507)


This pie chart represents the distribution of smart device usage over the given period (12.03.2016 to 12.05.2016), categorized into three levels:

- Low use (0 to 15 days) – 5.71% (Red) → Bottom 25% of users
- Moderate use (16 to 44 days) – 77.15% (Blue) → Middle 50% of users
- High use (45 to 60 days) – 17.14% (Green) → Top 25% of users
  
Key observation:

- The majority of users fall into the moderate usage category (16-44 days), making up the middle 50% of the dataset.
- The high-use category (45 to 60 days) represents the top 25% of users, indicating that only a quarter of users engage frequently with their smart devices.
- The low-use category (0-15 days) accounts for the lower 25%, showing minimal interaction with the device.
